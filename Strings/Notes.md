A string will be created after adding '\0' to last element of a char array.

Example 

    char name[10]={'J','o','h,'n',\0}


Also a string can be declared
uisng

    char name [] ="John"
	
	
Lower and Upper case

Note that minus -32 to char between A-Z will make it lowercase and
adding +32 between a-z will make it upper case

For Example

'a+32='A'

'A'-32='a' 


This because of ASCII Code standard
