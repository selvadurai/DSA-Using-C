Binary Tree
 
  -degree of 2 is a binary tree
  -degree means the the maxium size children a parent can have..

  The forumula for calculating the number of binary trees the number of nodes can have is T(n)=(2npower(Cn)) /n+1

 
   Max Height Formula Max Height = 2power(n)  4=2power(2) so 4 is the max height   if there are two nodes. 


The formula for filling in trees is T(n)=(2npower(Cn)) / (n+1) *(n!)

  Formula
  Min Nodes= h+1

  Max Nodes= a(r pow(k+1) - 1) /(r-1)
  Max Nodes =2pow(h+1)-1

  Max Height h=n-1
  Min Height h=log 2 (n+1)-1


Internal Nodes means the node must have a child
External Nodes mean the node must not have children

Find external Node equation

deg(0)= deg(2) + 1


Strict Binary tree means the tree can only have a degree of 0 or 1


Full Binary Tree- A height having maxium nodes.
